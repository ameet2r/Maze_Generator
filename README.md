# Maze_Generator

Within this repository there are two code bases. One is the Java implementation of a Maze Generator. The second is a Javascript implementation of the Maze Generator.

The Javascript Maze Generator
   *  Was created using the JSweet Transpiler to turn the Java code into Javascript, and jsDelivr to allow the JavaScript file to be run on the Github page.

The job of the MazeGenerator is to:
  * Create and solves a maze of any given size using Depth first search.

The mazes will be made up of 'X' and '+' characters. Where the 'X' characters are the walls and the '+' characters are the path to solve the maze.
